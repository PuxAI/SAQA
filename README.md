Solution Architects QA AI Chatbot

iDesign AI is an open-source app framework built specifically for Solution Architects.
It provides an AI assistent for IT architecture.
If you want to train the iDesign AI on specific data, you can upload a document or a confluence page (TBD). 
This document is embedded (e.g. transformed from text to data and stored in a vector database)
and can be used by the AI assistent with retrieval augmented generation.

To run the Solution Architects QA AI Chatbot:
python -m streamlit run Chat.py
